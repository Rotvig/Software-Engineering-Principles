StartPushed = FALSE \\
Microwave = OFF \\
MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\
DoorSwitch = OFF \\
AlarmTimeCounter = 0 \\
InitialAlarmTime = 0 \\
Lamp = OFF \\
SounderBuzzer = OFF \\
ChosenIntensity = Ã˜\\
CookingIntensity = 5


\section{Microwave cooking}
For the microwave to start an initial alarmTime must be chosen and the start button is pushed. Furthermore the door must be closed. When the timer hits 0 or lower the microwave stops. If the door is opened the microwave stops. \\
\\
Requirement tracing: FR-1, FR-2, FR-3 FR-5, FR-7\\
\\
Microwave = ON $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $\geq$ 0 $\wedge$ InitialAlarmTime $\geq$ 0  $\wedge$ StartPushed = TRUE $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $\rightarrow$ $-5$ $\wedge$ CookingIntensity = ChosenIntensity


\section{A Door Closed switch}
Requirement: This switch indicates that the door of the microwave oven is  closed.\\
\\
Requirement tracing: FR-6\\
\\
DoorSwitch = ON  $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = OPEN  \\
DoorSwitch = CLOSED $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\


\section{A Buzzer}
Requirement: The buzzer notifies the user when the desired time has passed. \\
\\
 Requirement tracing: FR-4\\
\\
SounderBuzzer = ON $\implies$ AlarmTimeCounter $<$ 0 $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $>$ -5 $\wedge$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\

\section{Lamp illuminates when microwave is started}
Requirement: When the start button is pressed then a lamp illuminates \\
\\
 Requirement tracing: FR-8\\
\\
LAMP = ON $\implies$ StartPushed = TRUE $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $>$ 0
