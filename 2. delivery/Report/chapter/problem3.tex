StartPushed :== TRUE | FALSE \\
Microwave ::= ON | OFF  \\
MicrowaveDoor ::= OPEN | CLOSED \\
DoorSwitch ::= ON| OFF \\
AlarmTimerOn ::= TRUE | FALSE
AlarmTimeCounter ::= $\mathbb{Z}$ \\
InitialAlarmTime ::= $\mathbb{Z}$ \\
Lamp ::= ON | OFF \\
SoundBuzzer ::= ON | OFF \\

\subsection{Init}

StartPushed = FALSE \\
Microwave = OFF \\
MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\
DoorSwitch = OFF \\
AlarmTimeCOunter = 0 \\
InitialAlarmTime = 0 \\
Lamp = OFF \\
SounderBuzzer = OFF \\

\subsection{Microwave cooking}
For the microwave to start an initial alarmTime must be chosen and the start button is pushed. Furthermore the door must be closed. When the timer hits 0 or lower the microwave stops. If the door is opened the microwave stops. \\
\\
Microwave = ON $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $\geq$ 0 $\wedge$ InitialAlarmTime $\geq$ 0 $\wedge$ StartPushed = TRUE $\wedge$ AlarmTimeCounter $\rightarrow$ 0


\subsection{A Door Closed switch}
Requirement: This switch indicates that the door of the microwave oven is  closed.

DoorSwitch = ON  $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = OPEN  \\
DoorSwitch = CLOSED $\implies$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\


\subsection{A Buzzer}
Requirement: The buzzer notifies the user when the desired time has passed. \\
 \\
SounderBuzzer = ON $\implies$ AlarmTimeCounter $<$ 0 $\wedge$ MicrowaveDoor = CLOSED \\
SounderBuzzer = OFF $\implies$ AlarmTimeCounter $\geq$ 0 $\vee$ MicrowaveDoor = OPEN   \\
\\

\subsection{Lamp illuminates when microwave is on}
Requirement: When the start button is pressed then a lamp illuminates \\
\\
Lamp = ON  $\implies$ Microwave = ON $\wedge$ InitialAlarmTime > (AlarmTimeCounter +2) \\
