\chapter{Problem 4 - Maintenance and reuse}
Because it is a low-cost microwave oven the hardware components that are used are not feasible to reuse. The life span of the components are estimated to be 5 years. But the software can be reused in similar products. The timer is one of the features that can be copy directly to other products like a new microwave oven or an oven. The software controlling the keypad can also be reused directly in other procducts, that uses keypads. The software controlling the hardware can be reused with minor modifications, so it fits the other products needs. 
The software is made reusable by following the SOLID design  principle for creating good, reliable and reusable software.
