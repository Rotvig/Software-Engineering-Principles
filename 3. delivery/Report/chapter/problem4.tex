\chapter{Problem 4 - Maintenance and reuse}
\subsection{Reuse}
Because it is a low-cost microwave oven the hardware components that are used are not feasible to reuse. The life span of the components are estimated to be 5 years. But the software can be reused in similar products. The timer is one of the features that can be used in other products like a new microwave oven or an oven. The software controlling the keypad can also be reused directly in other products, that uses keypads. 
The software is made reusable by following the SOLID design  principle for creating good, reliable and reusable software.  


\subsection{Maintenance}
The maintenance of the software will be minor a assignment in the project. If reoccurring software problems are detected in production and too many microwave ovens are refunded then the errors will be fixed and a new version of the software will be used in future production. It will then also be possible to update microwave ovens already in production with the new software.
