\section{Project objectives and constraints}

Objective: Developing a low-cost microwave oven. 

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
	\item Measures: 0.43 cm (w) x 39 cm (d) x 35 (h) approx.
	\item Casing: polished steel ( 1.5 mm approx).
	\item Power supply: 230 V AC.
\end{itemize}

The microwave oven has the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
	\item A Keypad with 12 keys: 0 to 9, Start and Timer. Through the keypad the user enters
	time and the desired function (timer or microwave).

	\item A Door Closed switch. This switch indicates that the door of the microwave oven is
	closed.

	\item A Magnetron Tube. This device emits the waves required for cooking in the cooking
	chamber.
	
	\item A Buzzer. The buzzer notifies the user when the desired operation is done.
\end{itemize}

Embedded processor (currently a derivative of the Z80 has been chosen).

The new microwave oven must be on the market within 10 months to be profitable.

\section{Project schedule}
Figure \ref{fig:activityplan} is an activity plan for the project. All activities are uniquely identified by a Letter. All numbers which relates to time are in months. These activities has been assigned to the staff which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:schedule}
