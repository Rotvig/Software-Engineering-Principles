	\begin{itemize}
		\item Document standards
		
			This project could potentially expand later on in the documentation face. When expanding a project some documentation standards has to be followed. All the documentation will help freelance and new developers to be familiar with the code.  
		\item Code standards
		
			Code standards will be implemented. This will help the structure of the code in the project and in the end heighten the quality of the code.

	\item Quality control
		
		Quality control ensures that the software team development have followed project quality procedures and standards.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reviews and inspections
		
			Reviews and inspections is an important part of the software development. It helps to align the actual software with the requirements and see if they are fulfilled.
		\item Automated software assessment
		
			Unit test and integration tests will help to asses the code and confirm it follows the requirements. 
		\item User tests
			
			User tests can help to test if the requirements or software are according to what the user base demands.
