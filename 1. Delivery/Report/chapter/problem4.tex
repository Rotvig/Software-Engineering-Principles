	\item Quality assurance	
	
		Quality assurance is a running process alongside the actual coding. It helps to make sure the code is following the standards.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Document standards
		
			As this project could potentially be expanded later on documentation would be in order. For this there are needed certain standards. All the documentation will help developers which are not familiar with the code.  
		\item Code standards
		
			Certain code standards will be implemented for the project. This will help the structure of the code and in the end heighten the quality of the code. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Quality control
		
		Quality control ensures that the software team development have followed project quality procedures and standards.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reviews and inspections
		
			Reviews and inspections is an important part of the software development. It helps to align the actual software with the requirements.
		\item Automated software assessment
		
			Unit test and integration tests will help to asses the code and confirm it follows the requirements.
		\item User tests
			
			User tests can help to test if the requirements or software are according to what the user base demands.
