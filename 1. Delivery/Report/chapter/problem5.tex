\chapter{Problem 5}

In case of unexpected delays a number of possible work items can be sacrificed or changed into a cheaper solution. It is relevant to note that the product will already be produced as a low-comport product with almost only minimum of functionality. Therefore not much functionality can be sacrificed but a few items is listed below in prioritized order. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Removing the number keys and the timer button. 

Instead the start button will just add 30 seconds every time it is pushed. Furthermore the start button will still start the cooking.
	
\item Removing the buzzer. 

The user will not be notified by the buzzer when the timer reaches 0d. The user must instead go look at the microwave if the timer has reached 0.

\end{enumerate}
%It is important that you are on time. Otherwise the company is expected to suffer substantial financial loss. Which work could you sacrifice in order to meet the deadline in case unexpected delays occur?

Removing any of these functionality is though not desired. As the product is also produced with minimum comport and therefore removing or modifying the functionality as stated above is not desired. Other possibilities should be taken into account before this is found necessary such as included in freelance engineers.
