\chapter{Problem 5}

In case of unexpected delays a number of possible work items can be sacrificed or changed into a cheaper solution.

\begin{itemize}

	\item The buzzer. The user will not be notified by the buzzer when the microwave oven is finished.
	


	\item Removing the number keys and the timer button. 
	
Instead the start button will just add 30 seconds every time it is pushed.

\end{itemize}
%It is important that you are on time. Otherwise the company is expected to suffer substantial financial loss. Which work could you sacrifice in order to meet the deadline in case unexpected delays occur?
