\chapter{Problem 3}

The time schedule is shown in figure \ref{fig:schedule}. It displays who is assigned to which tasks in the project. Furthermore it shows the expected time period of each activity.

In figure \ref{fig:schedule} each staff member has been assigned to a group with a color. The multicoloured columns represent that more than one group has been assigned to a task.

All activities identified in problem 1 is scheduled in figure \ref{fig:schedule}. It can be seen how some activities blocks other. For example the hardware and software must be completed before the final tests can be begin.

The integration of the chosen hardware components is therefore the first job of the hardware designer. The software engineers will initially be designing the software and then coding the software. The installation and test begins when the hardware components are integrated and the software is coded. The microwave is a critical device and therefore testing will be done in a period of 3 months to ensure that it is done sufficient.

During the coding of the software the system engineer will be doing test and quality assurance of the completed modules. This will give continuous feedback and aim at making the final installation and testing easier. Furthermore the system engineer will create a user manual for the device.
