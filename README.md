Autumn 2016

Mandatory Exercise 1

Lecturer: Stefan Hallerstede <sha@eng.au.dk>,

Instructor: Miran Hasanagic <miran.hasanagic@eng.au.dk>

6 September 2016

Hand-in: 13 September 2016


#### Problems ####
You have already verified that all of the physical components are readily available. It only
remains to develop the software for controlling operation of the microwave oven that runs
on an embedded processor (currently a derivative of the Z80 has been chosen). You have
2 software developers, 1 hardware designer and 1 system engineer available. The software
engineers and the hardware engineer have small children. The target industry is highly
competitive. Thus, the new microwave oven must be on the market within 10 months to
be profitable.

(1) Plan and schedule the necessary activities.

(2) What are the risks and how do you deal with them?

(3) Assign the staff to the activities. It is spring time and development will commence on
1 September.

(4) How do you achieve the appropriate level of quality?

(5) It is important that you are on time. Otherwise the company is expected to suffer
substantial financial loss. Which work could you sacrifice in order to meet the deadline
in case unexpected delays occur?

#### Instructions ####
 
• Work on the mandatory exercises in groups of 6. (Send names of group members to
sha@eng.au.dk.)

• Mark clearly your answers to different problems.

• Clearly state your names on your hand-ins.

### Requirements ###

#### Problems ####

(1) Improve the requirements and bring them into a traceable form.

(2) Model the microwave oven using problem frames.
(You have to create a context diagram and problem diagrams for the subproblems.)

(3) Specify the state and the basic operations in Z.

(4) Write a state chart specification for the microwave operation.

(5) Annotate your models such that the requirements can be traced into them.

(6) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three models?
Would you profit from their combined use?
