% What kind of verification is best suited for the microwave oven?

Different verification methods can be used for the microwave oven. Inspection and review, unit testing, integration testing, regression testing and formal methods could be used for the verification of the microwave oven. For most cases such as the microwave oven it makes sense to combine the different methods. Some methods might be used more extensively than others. 

Generally unit testing is good for finding defects in the written code. Integration testing verifies that the integrated components work together. Regression testing can ensure that added functionality did not introduce defects in the existing functionality. Inspection and review can be used for peer reviews of the written code and give another view on the implementation.

In general testing finds defects but never ensure absence of defects. Testing evolves around a few boundary cases which are created to find defects. Using formal methods can instead verify the absence of certain defects. 

Therefore a combination of different testing methods and formal methods is recommended to use for a device such as a microwave oven.
