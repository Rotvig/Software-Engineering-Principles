% What kind of verification is best suited for the microwave oven?

Different verifications methods can be used for the microwave oven. Inspection and review, unit testing, integration testing, regression testing and formal methods could be used for the verification of the microwave oven. For most cases such as the microwave oven it makes sense to combine the the different verification methods. Some methods might be used more extensively than others. 

Generally unit testing is good for finding defects in the written code. Integrations testing can be used to verify that the integrated components work together and regression testing can be used to ensure that added functionality did not introduce defects in the existing functionality. Inspection and review can be used for peer reviews of the written code and give another view on the implementation.

In general testing can be used to detect defects but newer ensure absence of defects. Testing evolves around a few boundary cases which are created to find defects. Using formalt methods can instead verify the absence of certain defects. 

Therefore a combination of different testing methods and formalt methods is recommended to use for a device such as a microwave oven.
