\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item  Verify the program

We can verify the code by introducing an invariant in the loop. The invariant must always hold.


\begin{lstlisting}

{
	assert m == m0;
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<k; i++) {
		m = m + x;
		invariant 0 <= i <= k  /\ m == m0 + (x * k)
	}
	assert m == m0 + (x * k);
}
\end{lstlisting}


\item Will the program always work correctly

If k has value lower than 0 and x is not equal to 0 then the invariant will not hold. Having a k lesser than zero would also make the last assert fail as the loop would terminate after zero iterations and then m would still be equal to the initial value and therefore not $m0 + (x*k)$ assuming x is not zero.


\item  Use the assertions to generate a unit test case for the “inner program”

When generating unit tests it is important to focus on boundary cases to ensure that it is possible to actually create and run the tests within some given time frame.

Code under test:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
int i;
for(i=0; i<k; i++) {
	m = m + x;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

So in the unit tests it must hold that when the loop is done m must equal m+x*k. This is the assertion we are making in certain scenarios. The test scenarios are the following
\begin{itemize}
	\item k given positive value, zero and a negative value
	\item x given positive value, zero and a negative value
	\item m given positive value, zero and a negative value
\end{itemize}

This would result in $3^3$ unit tests to test all combinations. In this report we focus on 7 of the combinations. So for each possible value of the variables we only set the other variables to a positive value. More combinations could therefore be added to the tests.

\begin{lstlisting}
 [Fact]
 public void AllValuesArePositive()
 {
	 int k = 5, x = 5, m = 5;
	 Assert.Equal(m+x*k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m ));
 }
 
 [Fact]
 public void KIsNegative()
 {
	 int k = -1, x = 5, m = 5;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 
 [Fact]
 public void KEqualsZero()
 {
	 int k = 0, x = 5, m = 5;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 [Fact]
 public void XIsZero()
 {
	 int k = 5, x = 0, m = 5;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 [Fact]
 public void XIsNegative()
 {
	 int k = 5, x = -5, m = 5;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 [Fact]
 public void MIsZero()
 {
	 int k = 5, x = 5, m = 0;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 [Fact]
 public void MIsNegative()
 {
	 int k = 5, x = 5, m = -5;
	 Assert.Equal(m + x * k, CodeUnderTest(k, x, m));
 }
 
 int CodeUnderTest(int k, int x, int m)
 {
	 int i;
	 for (i = 0; i < k; i++)
	 {
		 m = m + x;
	 }
	 return m;
 }
\end{lstlisting}

When we run the test we get the following
\myFigure{unittests}{Result of unit test runner}{fig:test}{0.75}

We see that the initial value of k must not be less than zero. This is also what was expected from the analysis of the verification.

\newpage
\item What could be gained by combined testing and proving?

As more generally stated in problem 1 a combination of the two methods are beneficial as they introduce two different aspects of verification. With the use of tests, defects can be found and located in the software. With formal methods the absence of defects can be verified.

Also formal methods are used to verify a model of the implemented software. So generating unit tests based on the proof and model to test the actual implementation is very relevant. Therefore a combination of the two is beneficial.
