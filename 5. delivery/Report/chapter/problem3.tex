\label{chp:three}

%Devise a plan to deal with safety issues after deployment of the machine. State the three most important measures you take.

Different measurements can be taken to deal with safety issues during operation. In general redundant components could be added to deal with safety issues but as the system is low cost, redundant components are too expensive and shutdown, restart or permanent termination are preferred to deal with issues.

The following three measures will be taken to reduce risk with safety issues:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Automatic permanent termination if a malfunction results in too high radiation or if the door is opened during cooking
	\item Minor software malfunction results in automatic restart
	\item Relevant error codes will be shown on the display after automatic restart or permanent termination so the support department can communicate errors that have happend during operation such that the issues can be fixed
\end{itemize}
