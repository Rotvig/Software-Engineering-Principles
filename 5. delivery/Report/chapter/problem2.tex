%Update your project plan to take necessary to deal with the safety requirements. Provide an updated activity network. Can you keep the deadline with one more staff? What staff do you need?

To deal with the safety requirements some items could be sacrificed or changed as descriped in exercise 1. Another solution could be to introduce a new staff member. But as unexpected delays has already been discussed and solutions for these found it would definitely still be possible to meet the deadline.

With one more staff none of the items would needed to be sacrificed or changed. Another software developer would be added to the team and this would make the development period shorter and give more time to testing. This is shown on the activity diagram in figure \ref{fig:activity} and the time schedule in figure \ref{fig:gantt}
