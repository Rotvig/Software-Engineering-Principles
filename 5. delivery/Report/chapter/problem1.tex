%Carry out a harzard analysis for the microwave oven. What are the major hazards? How and why?

In this chapter, a hazard analysis is carried out. This will help the project be prepared for safety issues.

\begin{description}
	\item[Containment loss] It is a safety concern if the magnetron tube starts when the door to the Microwave oven is not closed. This would mean the radiation that the magnetron tube emits would not be contained in the Microwave. Likewise it would be critical if the magnetron tube does not stop when the door is opened. For example if the microwave was heating food, and the user opens the door before the timer has run out. This could result in material damage and injury to users.
